Project details Wiring analyzer: 
Automated test set up developed as an inspection tool to check the continuity, unwanted shorts, opens and exchange in connections of wired back panels, printed Circuit boards, cable harness. 
ILS Tester: 
Tester developed for Indian Air Force to test and calibrate the onboard (airborne) ILS, VOR and marker receivers associated with landing system of aircraft 
This is a micro controller based RF Transmitter System having analog, digital circuits for control and monitoring functions and an RF unit for RF generation, Modulation, Amplification and Transmission. 
TFT Interface unit: 
Xilinx FPGA based board developed to use as a display data converter module for some CNC machines. 
This enabled the use of LCD-TFT displays in place of CRT monitors. 
Vibrometer testers: 
Tester and Simulator developed for Indian air force to test and calibrate onboard (Airborne) vibration monitoring systems of helicopters aircrafts which generate warning and alarm signals when the vibration of engine exceeds the specified range Radio Compass Tester: 
Tester developed for Indian Air Force to test and calibrate the automatic radio compass, electromagnetic heading selectors associated with navigation systems of aircraft Wireless Transceivers, Modem: 
Wireless Transceivers developed for BARC for transmitting the seismic signals from field sensor units to central monitoring station Electrostatic Control units for Powder coating Systems : 
System to generate and control the high Voltage (about 100 kV) for industrial powder coating application. These are processor based board which generates variable output voltage up to 20 volts to generate and control the high voltage power coating guns. 
PWM controlled pressure regulators/valves for Powder coating Systems: 
This is a part of power coating application. This is a Micro controller based board which controls the valve to maintain the output pressure ( 0- 100 PSI) based on the settings. , High Voltage multiplier: 
Part of powder coating system which generates high voltage up to 100 KV 
Customized PLC module: 
These are 
PLC on chip based units developed as a customized PLC with ladder support ( Divelbiss make chip with EZ ladder) to replace the traditional PLCs used Board Testers: 
Testers developed to perform automatic functional testing of the boards during production - These are measurement module (USB and PCI slot type) based systems which have got digital, and analog circuits, bed of nails used to test and calibrate the boards during bulk production 
GSM based remote monitoring units 
These are SIM900B modem and Microcontroller based Units developed to transmit the working status / error messages of the power coating booths through SMS to the operator.
