Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T) Kharagpur India 
BTECH IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 2013 - PRESENT CGPA - 7.64 on a scale of 10 PROJECTS & TRAINING BTECH Project(Prof. Jhareswar Maiti) IIT Kharagpur, India 
UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER, IIT KHARAGPUR July. 2016 - Exp. Apr. 2017 
Project Title: Development of an early dynamic RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion) detection system in hot and humid environment. 
Developed an android application that takes static inputs from the worker and predicts their health index. 
Working on getting the dynamic data from worker and surroundings with the help of ICT based data capture system. 
Research Project(Prof. Jhareswar Maiti) IIT Kharagpur, India 
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS USING OPTIMIZED SVM Jul. 2016 - Sep. 2016 
The main objective was to build a model which could predict the occupational incidents using support vector machine (SVM). 
Performed optimization of SVM by using Grid Search (GS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and BAT algorithm to obtain better accuracy. 
Conference paper titled Study of Optimized SVM for Incident Prediction is accepted by INDICON-2016, Bangalore. 
Results: Grid search-based SVM outperformed other optimized SVM approaches with 88.0 % accuracy Industrial Experience Pune, India 
DATA SCIENTIST AT INNOPLEXUS, INDIA May. 2016 - Jul. 2016 
Project Title : Ontology- Data Crawling, Analysis and Aggregation 
Crawled 30 different websites in python using libraries BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium. 
Programmed a python class for parsing different file formats into JSON format and dumping them into Mongo Database. 
Project Title : Accuracy enhancement of document classifier by leveraging Ontology 
Developed binary classifier models using supervised learning techniques like Naive Bayes, nu-SVM, linear classifier-SVM, KNN. 
Keywords(unigrams), Keyphrases(multigrams) are extracted using a phrase extraction technique after noise elimination (NLTK). 
Calculated TF-IDF vectorizer for each feature on different corpus for improving model accuracy. 
Constructed classification class decider by leveraging wordnet ontology and unifying synonymous features. 
Received a Pre-Placement Offer in recognition of my contribution to the projects Research Project(Prof. Jhareswar Maiti) IIT Kharagpur, India 
ACCIDENT MODELING AND ANALYSIS Nov. 2015 - Apr. 2016 Employed Text Mining approach to find the root causes that could lead to the occurrences of faults. 
The root causeswere thenutilized inbuilding theFault tree transformedBayesianNetworkdiagrams that couldpredict theoccurrence of incidents. 
Finally, rule-cause extraction was done for better understanding of the causes of incidents in the steel plant. 
Journal paper titled An Investigation from Text and Categorical Data of Incident Reports in a Steel Plant Using Data Mining 
Techniques -completed and is under review. 
Results: Achieved an accuracy of 87.5%, 71.4%, and 87.5% for injury, near miss, and property damage related incidents. 
Industrial Experience Chennai, India 
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES Dec-2014 
Submitted a technical project report on Variable Valve Timing in Automotive IC Engine Design & Development under the aegis of Expertshub facilitators. 
Was awarded certificate of excellence for the project prepared.
