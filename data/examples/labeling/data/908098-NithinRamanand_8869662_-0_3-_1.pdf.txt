Title 1: 
Generic PID Controller Team Size: 3 Technologies Used: Atmega 8L Microcontroller, Code Vision AVR 
Project Objective: To use Generic PID as a control system to improve fuel efficiency in a vehicle. 
Concepts Utilized: Duty Cycle, Timers, USART, ADC 
Description: Completed a project on Generic PID controller. Applied different concepts of microcontroller. Developed a code for PID controller and performed testing on a system. Monitored the PID control action on a system. 
Key findings: Proximity of sensor to motor impacts rotational speed. If applied to an automotive engine during idle position, air & fuel mixture can be optimized and therefore increase fuel efficiency. 
Title2: 
Benchmarking of ECU Extra Curricular
