PROJECT COMPLETION ON VERIFICATION OF WEDGE INDENTATION BY EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL SLIP-LINE METHOD ON RIGID-PLASTIC MATERIALS PROJECT OVERVIEW-Slip line fields distinguishing to understand measured friction and wear co-efficients to be related to calculated stress and strains via Coffin-Manson low fatigue cycle rule to investigate experimentally and theoretically on wedge indentation of the profiles of undergone elements I.E Mild Steel and Alluminium 
ASSUMPTIONS-Certain phenomenons considered were,Plane strain deformations;Quasi static loading;No temperature change;No body force;Element under experiment is rigid- perfectly plastic 
CONCLUSION-The project was inferred near to perfect with help of reputed institutes CGCRI and KGEC with the guidance of Mr.Arup Kumar Bose(Asst.Prof,Mech Engg.,KGEC) INFERENCE-The effort was considered good enough earning an distinguishable remark from the WBUT and notable enough to be considered for recognisition in our instituition,KGEC CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS EARNED DURING B.TECH WORK EXPERIENCE
