1: Development of a battery degradation model for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. 
Organisation: SYSU CMU Joint Institute of Engineering, Guangzhou, China 
May 16-July 16 Worked on battery degradation model for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. 
Test the state of charge estimation and cell balancing algorithms using battery-in-the-loop research setup. 
2: Development of a Fingerprint Biometric Based Classroom Attendance Management System 
Organisation: Indian Institute of Information Technology, SriCity, Andhra Pradesh, India 
May 15-June 15 
A prototype Classroom Attendance Management System (CAMS) is developed that uses fingerprint biometric for recording the students attendance. 
The biometric data is stored dynamically in a database that is linked to web-based user interface. Different statistics can be computed and presented on web-page, such as month-wise or semester-wise attendance. 
KEY PROJECTS 
1: 
Soul for Life HAPTIC SHOES 
This project proposes to trace the person s path by interfacing smartphone s Bluetooth and controller board using his/her coordinates, which in turn can be used to visualise its path in google maps. 
Furthermore, the maps formed can give direction through blind person using vibrations in his/her shoes. 
The Bluetooth-enabled smart shoes vibrate to give people directions and tell them where to turn as they travel along. 
2: 
Fire Alarm System Using VHDL 
The objective is to detect fire in an area. 
Initiate automatic fire control and suppression system and to fire the alarm immediately. 
The project is implemented on Spartan 3E FPGA board and makes use of smoke sensor to detect the fire. 
3: 
Home Automation based on Internet of Things 
The basic aim of project is to control or monitor signals from different appliances, or basic services. 
A smart phone or web browser can be used to control or monitor the home automation system. 
There will be a web socket which will have different toggle buttons for different appliances.
