WORK EXPERIENCE M. Tech Project: Production of hydrogen from waste water sludge by dark fermentation 
Adviser: P. Mondal, IIT Roorkee 
Aug 2014-May 2015 o Designed and built an experimental set-up to produce hydrogen from waste water sludge by anaerobic digestion in absence of light o Performed incubation and measure hydrogen production due to bacterial decomposition using gas chromatography o Investigated the effect of various environment factors such as temperature, pH and substrate conditions on hydrogen production o Optimized the process parameter and developed input output model by Design of Experiment (D.O.E) 
B. Tech Project: Production of Bio-fertilizer from food wasteby decomposing using cyanobacteria 
Adviser: P. Rath, JITM Orissa 
Aug 2010 
May 2011 
o Prepared BG-13 medium by using solidifying agent, 
AGAR, to isolate cyanobacteria o Improved quality of fertilizer by removing the contamination from waste food through monitoring the decrease in carbon-nitrogen ratio and increase in nitrogen content in bioreactorwith the help of CHNS analyzer. 
o Validated the superiority of bio-fertilizer over chemical fertilizers by demonstrating that the former one increases the soil-fertility even when used excessively
