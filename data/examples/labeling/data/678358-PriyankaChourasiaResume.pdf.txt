I am looking for a bright future in copywriting, where I can amalgamate my academic background in Mass Communication with my passion in writing. A strong believer in ' Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings' A few are born with the gift of creativity and I unravelled this God gifted talent within me, way back in college days. I read emotions behind words and write my heart out . 'Your write-ups are engaging , that's what my readers say and all these praises and a lot of self worth keeps me going.
