Final Year Project: 
Performance Enhancement of Android Applications Testing Using Android Devices As a Service Cloud Model. 
It was a twofold project. 
In the first part we have built a system that can extract and store Android sensors values like Accelerometer, Magnetometer and Gyroscope in an Excel sheet. This data is valuable for analysis of movements which forms as the base of all movement tracking applications (Nike plus). 
The second part consisted of an Android application that tracks resource consumption of all applications residing in an Android device, more like a task manager for Android which helps in analyzing apps which are heavy on resource consumption and their impact on the device.
