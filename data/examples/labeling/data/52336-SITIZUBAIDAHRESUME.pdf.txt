[ 2013-2014 ] Creating an Organic Battery Mini-thesis for Extended Essay for IB Biology HL, MARA College Banting, Malaysia 
The purpose of this study was to design an organic battery which is eco-friendly. I utilized the invasive weed, Chromolaena odorata and brown sugar to make the organic battery s electrolyte. Fermentation of Chromolaena odorata and brown sugar formed a solution which I addressed as electrolyte as it could generate voltage and current. 
Optimized concentrations of brown sugar and Chromolaena odorata to maximize voltage production. 
A gel with optimal electrolyte concentration was synthesized. 
With the same project as above (creating organic battery), I participated in: Intel ISEF Los Angeles [2012] Organic battery project had been selected to participate for Intel ISEF competition at Los Angeles 2012 Malaysian Association of Research Scientists (MARS) [2011] Received Bronze award for the innovation of the Organic Battery
