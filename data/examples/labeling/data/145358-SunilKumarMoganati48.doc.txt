Professional Experience : 
Project 1: Dual Channel Digital Actuator Controller (ASB) 
Company: Reliable Techno Systems India (P) Ltd Client: 
RCI, Hyderabad Role: Hardware Design Engineer Tools: 
Orcad, Flash Pro, Libero SoC and Visual Dsp++, Cadstar Description: 
The Digital Controller is having DSP processor with 16- channels ADC and 4-channels DAC. Input signal is giving to MIL-STD1553 or through ADC to interact with the main system. Since the Controller is going to place within the missile, all of the components were chosen as per MIL STDs. The OBC will control the position and velocity of the linear actuator with the main system command signal .The linear actuator is consist BLDC motor and LVDT. The PID technique used to control the position & velocity is analog PWM technique. 
Roles & Responsibilities: 
Hardware Design and Development of total project. 
Schematic entry and components selection. 
Net list checking BOM finalizing. 
Understanding different types of components ADSP, FPGA, ADC, DAC, UART, MIL-STD 1553 and Flash. 
Components placements guidelines and Isolations discussions with client. 
Board level, System level Debugging, integrating and product delivery. 
Project2: 
Design &Implementation of Digital Controller for Quick Response Solenoid Valve. 
Company: Reliable Techno Systems India (P) Ltd Client: 
RCI, Hyderabad Role: Hardware Design Engineer Tools: 
Orcad, Flash Pro, Libero SoC 
Description: 
The Controller is featured with Advanced Smart Fusion SoC which is having internal ADC, DAC, UART, FPGA, GPIOs. The Solenoid Valves are controlling by the PWM technique and this PWMs are Generated from FPGA. These Solenoid Valves ON and OFF condition is Done through 1553 Communication. 
Roles & Responsibilities: 
Schematic Design and Development. 
Understanding different types of components Smart Fusion FPGA, Mini Ace-1553, Current Sensor and MOSFETs.

Project3: 
PVT Characterization and Endurance Performance Testing 
Company: Mirafra Software Systems India (P) Ltd Client: 
Qualcomm Ind (P) Ltd, Chennai Role: 
Validation Engineer Tools: 
Ix Chariot, Tera term Vt,Putty. 
Description: 
PVT stands for process, voltage and temperature validation of silicon. PVT validation tests silicon with different process variation at voltage and temperature extremes to stress the device in ways other testing does not. The intention of PVT is to run validation content to find logic bugs that may be introduced due to process, voltage and temperature variations. 
Roles & Responsibilities: 
PVT Characterization performance testing for Qualcomm 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi reference design boards. 
Testing of Wi-Fi Access Points under different temperature conditions-40c, 0c, 25c, and 80c. And also running interoperability test with different Wi-Fi clients.
