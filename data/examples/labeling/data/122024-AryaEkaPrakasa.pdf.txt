ABOUT ME 
Hi, my name is Arya, I have been a designer for quite sometimes. Being a designer teaches me to think creatively in everything i do on day to day basis. It also peek my curiosity to almost everything. 
I am very good on working with a group, because i feed from entusiasm of others, it makes my brains rolling with ideas. In my spare time, i play music as a 
DJ. Music is my release from my stress, and makes me continue the next day.
