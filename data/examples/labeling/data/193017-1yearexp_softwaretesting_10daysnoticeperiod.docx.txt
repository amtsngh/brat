Role : Software Test Engineer. 
Project Title : Enlighted. 
Client : Enlighted, USA. 
Team Size 
: 6. 
Description: Enlighted supplies energy saving devices to customers. They fix them in customer sites and monitor the power consumed at each device. The data from these devices (like: power consumed, Occupancy, Brightness percentage, motion bits, etc.) are captured by Energy Managers and stored in a database. This database is known as EM Replica DB. A web based application known as Self Service Portal is being developed to provide reporting services to customers. Customers will login to use this application. Using the EM Replica DB (also called as Transaction DB) for reporting purposes would slow down the system. Hence a separate DB instance (called Reporting DB) is proposed which will be the presentation database. All reporting queries will be answered by the Reporting DB. ETL scripts / code (running as cron jobs / background batch processes) will extract the required data from EM Replica DB / EM Cloud DB, transform it and load it to the Reporting DB. This document describes the data model for the proposed Reporting DB and its ETL tasks.
