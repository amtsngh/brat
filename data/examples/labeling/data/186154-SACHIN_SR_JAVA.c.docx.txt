Academic Project 
Project Title:- OPIMIZATION OF MACHINING PARAMETERES IN DRILLING COMPOSITE MATERIAL 
Software used: MINITAB17, MRA, GMDH, ORIGIN9 
Description: Drilling is one of the oldest and the most widely used of all machining processes, comprising about one third of all metal-machining operations. Drilling of composite material by conventional tools has shown that the quality of the cut surface is strongly dependent on the cutting parameters, tool geometry, tool material, work piece material, machining process, etc. hence to select cutting parameters for damage-free drilling is necessary and also to find the optimum cutting parameters for damage free drilling.
