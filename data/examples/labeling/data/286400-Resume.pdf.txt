M.TECH PROJECTS 
Design of 1.2V 10ppm/0C CMOS Bandgap Reference in 180nm CMOS process 
First order compensated Bandgap Reference and its physical implementation, layout, DRC, Parasitic extraction, Post Layout simulations. 
Curvature Compensated CMOS Bandgap Reference - Piecewise nonlinear curvature corrected current is generated to correct the nonlinear temperature dependency of a conventional first order current mode BGR to achieve lower TC. 
B. TECH PROJECTS 
Smart Chair Microcontroller (ATMEGA16) based wheelchair (ZIGBEE, RFID and Touch screen technologies) to help people with walking disabilities to control the movement of chair and other applications. 
Mobile Bug Circuit to detect the presence of an activated mobile phone even if the mobile is in silent mode (555 IC). 
SEMINARS 
Li-Fi - A new paradigm in wireless communication - Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is optical wireless technology for wireless data transfer through visible light produced by white LED s used for illumination. It has better speed, flexibility and usability than Wi-Fi. 
A study on Hardware Supported Intrusion Detection Systems for Embedded Systems - Detection systems that will detect attacks in real-time. Processor operations are observed immediately, rather than waiting for the creation of an audit file. 
A Security Layer for Smartphone-to-Vehicle Communication Over Bluetooth - An ad-hoc, end-to-end security layer to hierarchically distributed control system architecture which integrates a smartphone with classical embedded systems. 
Smartphone can interact securely with a modern vehicle without requiring modifications to the existing in-vehicle network.
