EMPLOYMENT DETAILS 
From November 16, 2015 till September 02, 2016 with QOS Technology 
Projects handled: 
1. POC for building a web service to provide the Checkpoint Firewall Log Analysis information to the clients using the Checkpoint Firewall 
The project was aimed to build a POC model for building a UI for the SPLUNK users to analyze the Checkpoint firewall logs. The log file data were transferred to HDFS and SPARK was used to fetch the data from HDFS for filter and analysis using python. The analyzed data were then represented in form of charts and graphs in the UI for the user's view and interaction. This POC was aimed to provide complete user transparency during data fetch from HDFS and SPLUNK database. 
Key result areas: 
Was sole responsible for developing UI for the project 
Was sole responsible for developing user interactive charts and graph presentation using D3 JS interactive library Used python libraries for data fetching, filtering and evaluation as per customer requirements Involved in application development and application maintenance 
Providing overall coordination to the project 
Technologies used: 
Python, HDFS, SPARK streaming, Logstash 
HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, D3 JS 
Operating System used: 
Linux: Ubuntu 14.04/ CentOS 6 2 of 4 Windows 10 2. Web based online application for SPLUNK users to convert the uploaded log text file to xml 
The project was aimed for the integration with SPLUNK App users provided by QOS Technology for converting the uploaded text file containing the checkpoint raw logs to the required .xml file for checkpoint firewall logs analysis using splunk. Python was used for fetching, analyzing and converting to required xml file. PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery were integrated with python for developing the project UI. MYSQL was used for the user records and user transparency. The project was carefully designed to keep user transparency. 
Key result areas: 
Was a solo performer Involved in developing and testing the project 
Technologies used: 
Python, HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery MYSQL, PL/SQL 
Operating System used: 
Linux: Ubuntu 14.04 3. Responsive and animated transitional charts and graphs for SPLUNK web app UI hosted by QOS 
Technology 
This project was aimed to represent the result of log analysis in UI through interactive charts and graphs. The charts and graphs were represented and build using highly developed and interactive D3 javascript library. 
Key result areas: Build the responsive and charts and graphs using D3 javascript library Prepared pie, donut, table, bar etc graphs and charts using D3 javascript library 
Was a solo performer Involved in developing and testing the project 
Technologies used: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, D3 
Operating System used: 
Linux: Ubuntu 14.04 4. Live checkpoint file log transfer for analysis to HDFS using KAFKA, Logstash and SPARK 
This project was a POC for live and automated log file transfer to HDFS for analyzing. Logstash was used to continuously feed the log file data to Kafka producer topic as output. The Kafka consumer topic being the input accepts the log file sent from the producer and behaves as output to HDFS. The SPARK model then reads the HDFS 
3 of 4 to get the log file as input for analysis. Python API was used to build the spark model for reading the log files and analyzing. 
Key result areas:
