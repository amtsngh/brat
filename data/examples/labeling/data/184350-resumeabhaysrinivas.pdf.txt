Research Engineer Fluidyn Consultancy Pvt Ltd 
PERFORMING CFD ANALYSIS FOR VARIOUS CLIENT PROJECTS CONTRIBUTIONS & INNOVATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 
GENERATING CAD GEOMETRY AND MESH FOR PERFORMING ANALYSIS PERFORMING CFD AND THERMAL ANALYSIS ON VARIOUS CLIENT PROJECTS AND VALIDATION CASES 
POST PROCESSING RESULTS AND WRITING REPORTS AND PREPARING PRESENTATIONS 
PREPARING TUTORIALS FOR CLIENTS 
PERFORMING VALIDATION OF NEW SOLVER RELEASES AND TESTING FOR BUGS. 
PROJECTS: 
THX THERMOCOUPLES TYPE: CONSULTANCY DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING CHT ANALYSIS ON 2 DIFFERENT THERMOCOUPLE DESIGNS AT DIFFERENT PRESSURES AND LIQUID TEMPERATURES AND NOTING THE TEMPERATURE AT THE DIFFERENT THERMOCOUPLES AND ALSO CALCULATING THE LOCAL HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT AT VARIOUS SECTIONS. ALSO MULTIPHASE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING THE HEM MODEL TO CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF WATER EVAPORATED INTO STEAM AND THE THERMOCOUPLE TEMPERATURE WHEN STEAM WAS PRESENT TO 
THAT WHEN WATER WAS PRESENT. 
TOTAL SV TYPE: CONSULTANCY DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING SIMULATIONS FOR FLOW OF A IMMISCIBLE LIQUID INTO A TANK CONTAINING ANOTHER IMMISCIBLE LIQUID. THE SIMULATION WAS PERFORMED USING THE VOF METHOD. THE RISE IN HEIGHT OF THE LIQUID IN THE TANK OVER TIME WAS STUDIED SHIMIZU FIRE AND SMOKE ANALYSIS 
TYPE: CONSULTANCY DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING SIMULATIONS OF FLOW OF SMOKE INSIDE TUNNELS INCASE OF A FIRE. THE RATE OF PROPAGATION OF SMOKE AND THE EFFECT OF A VENTILATION CHAMBER ON THE SMOKE FLOW PATTERNS WAS STUDIED. TUTORIALS WERE MADE AND SENT TO THE CLIENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE TAR TYPE: VALIDATION 
DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING CHT ANALYSIS ON A THERMOACOUSITC REFRIGERATION UNIT. A SIMPLE 2D 
GEOMETRY OF A TAR WAS MODELLED AND CHT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING MOVING MESH METHOD TO SIMULATE THE EFFECT OF SOUND WAVE S COMPRESSION AND EXPANSION. THE TEMPERATURE ON THE STRUCTURAL STACKS WAS MEASURED HOT PLUME ANALYSIS IN A SEA BED TYPE: CONSULTANCY DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING CFD ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF INJECTION OF A HOT PLUME OF WATER INTO THE SEA. THE HEIGHT OF THE PLUME, THICKNESS OF THE PLUME AT DIFFERENT HEIGHT WAS STUDIED AND COMPARED WITH DIFFERENT MASS FLOW RATES OF THE HOT PLUME. 
WAVE EFFECT ANALYSIS TYPE: CONSULTANCY 
DESCRIPTION: THIS PROJECT INVOLVED PERFORMING CFD ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF A STORAGE TANK RUPTURE ON THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND DETERMINE 
THE DISTANCE TO WHICH THE LIQUID IN THE TANK WOULD FLOW.

TROUBLESHOOTING OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS WITH PROFICIENCY IN PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS. 
WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF COMPLEX FLOW PHYSICS, STRUCTURAL MECHANICS, AND NUMERICAL METHODS. 
CONTRIBUTIONS & INNOVATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 
WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON CAD TO GENERATE GEOMETRIES SUITABLE FOR SIMULATIONS 
USED STAR-CCM+ AND FINE-TURBO EXTENSIVELY TO PERFORM SIMULATIONS AND POST PROCESS THE RESULTS PERFORMED STATIC AND DYNAMIC STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS TO ASCERTAIN THE FEASIBILITY OF THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATION SCRIPTS (BASH SCRIPTS, PYTHON SCRIPTS, JAVA MACROS) TO AUTOMATE THE GENERATION OF GEOMETRY, PERFORMING SIMULATIONS FOR VARIOUS BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND POST PROCESS ADVANCED DEGREE ABSTRACTS MS: Novel Compressor Blade Design Study 
SUMMARY INCLUDES: 
SOILDWORKS WAS USED TO GENERATE A CAD GEOMETRY SUITABLE FOR SIMULATION 
EXTENSIVE STRUCTURAL AND CFD ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON THE DESIGN USING ANSYS AND STARCCM+ 
THE DESIGN WAS RUN FOR 5 DIFFERENT TIP CLEARANCES THE PROCESS WAS AUTOMATED BY CREATING JAVA MACROS AND BATCH SCRIPTS SPEEDLINES WERE CREATED AND THE EFFECT OF TIP CLEARANCE TO PEAK EFFICIENCY WAS STUDIED STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED IN ANSYS TO STUDY THE STURCTURAL LIMITATIONS OF THE DESIGN 
Bachelors: CFD Analysis of Turbulent Flow Past A Delta Wing 
SUMMARY INCLUDES: 
NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF 3-D TURBULENT INCOMPRESSIBLE FLOW PAST AN ISOLATED BACKWARD SWEPT DELTA WING MADE OF A 
BICONVEX AIRFOIL SECTION. 
THE COMPUTATION USES THE PRESSURE BASED FINITE VOLUME RANS CODE RANS3D COUPLED TO EDDY VISCOSITY BASED TURBULENCE MODEL AND A MULTI-BLOCK STRUCTURED BOUNDARY ORTHOGONAL CURVILINEAR GRID. 
THE AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE OF BICONVEX AIRFOIL SECTION IS ESTIMATED FROM THE PREDICTED DISTRIBUTION OF THE SURFACE PRESSURE AND THE WALL SHEAR STRESS, DERIVED FROM CFD ANALYSIS FOR BOTH 2-D AND 3-D CONFIGURATION.
