PROJECT PROFILE: 
Solar Water Heater Using Temperature Sensor and Valve Technique With 
Controlled Outlets 
Solar water heating (SWH) system comprises several innovations and many mature renewable energy technologies, which have been accepted in most countries for many years. Solar water heating is widely used in most of the countries in all over the world. Nowadays, the world s demand of energy has increased, and it is the natural, safe and costless process to collect hot water by solar radiations. There are many applications of the hot water heated by the solar radiations. Where the solar hot water is used in the domestic purposes, it also be used in industrial applications, e.g. used for electricity generation. Designs suitable for hot climates can be much simpler and cheaper and can be considered an appropriate technology for these places. In this method, the water is heated to the set temperature using a temperature sensor and valve technique. The solenoid valves are used in the circulating and outlet path. This helps in circulating the water in the solar heater to attain the desired temperature. Once the desired temperature is reached then the water is allowed for use. 
IEEE PAPER: Effects of Formation of Ice and Ice Melt Technologies on HVDC Transmission 
Line 
HVDC transmission over both overhead lines & underground cables is becoming more & more popular. The various applications of high DC voltage in industries, research medical science etc. The DC transmission provides many technical advantages, which are not offered by AC transmission.When the transmission line is coated with ice, the thickness and size of the conductor increases. The thickness depends on the weather conditions. This causes increase in weight of the conductor. 
Increase in weight increases the vertical sag. The weight will acts downwards in the same direction of conductor.A snowmelt system is used to remove snow and ice via embedded electric cables or hydronic tubing. Common areas for snowmelt systems are: driveways, walkways, parking areas, stairways, wheelchair ramps, loading docks, and around car washes. A snowmelt system is usually installed during the original construction in concrete ,asphalt , mastic asphalt or under pavers. Retrofit electric systems can also be installed using saw cutting technology or on top of existing concrete, asphalt, or mastic asphalt surfaces if the existing surface is on grade.
