WORK EXPERIENCE 
Total work Experience: 2.3 years NXTGen solutions 
From Dec 2013 to March 2016 
I worked as an embedded developer. During the course of time I have worked with different kinds of controllers and have developed various projects assigned by them. 
My role was to involve into coding using embedded C with8051, PIC16F877A, MSP430 and ARM7TDMI. 
Design and documentation of the project. 
I have worked on battery management project which has got STM32L151 ARM processor. My part in the project was into basic regression testing of the project. 
The test was intended to manage the charge and discharge of 1 or 2 
Li-Fe(A123)batteries in a mobile clinical workstation, where it supplies a nominal 12 VDC to the computer, display, and associated electronics. 
Charge/discharge testing Li-Fe 1 or 2 batteries. 
Failure Mode testing Temperatre sensor,Voltage limits,Current limits based on VTP . 
Writing TDC to document test case failures in above procedure.
