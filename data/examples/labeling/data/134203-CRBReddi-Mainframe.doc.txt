Project Description 
This is a Govt. Regulatory compliance project for Metavantes Cardbase (CMS) Product (Cardbase Management System), Regulation E rules as laid down by Federal Reserve System for implementing Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) requires the limitation on the ability of a Financial Institution to assess/charge an Overdraft Fee for paying ATM & POS one-time debit transactions that overdraw a consumers account unless the consumer affirmatively consents or Opts In, to the FIs payment of Overdrafts for these transactions. This regulatory rules are effective Jan 19th ,2010 with a mandatory compliance date of July 1st ,2010. 
Historically, if a consumer tried to make a payment using a check thatwould overdraw his or her depositaccount, the consumers financialinstitution used its discretion on an ad-hoc basis to determine whether to paythe overdraft. If an overdraft was paid,the institution usually imposed a fee onthe consumers account. In recent years,many institutions have automated theoverdraft payment process, whichreduces costs and ensures consistenttreatment of consumers.Automation isused to apply specific criteria fordetermining whether to honoroverdrafts and to set limits on theamount of coverage provided.
